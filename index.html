 <b> will You Be a Problem Solver? </b> <br> <br>
     Every year, technological devices become faster, smaller, and smarter. <br>
      In fact, your cell phone holds more information than the room-sized computers <br>
       that sent a man to the moon! <br>
     
     In my essay Can Today's College Students Solve World Problems? <br>
      I talk about how advances like the green revolution and more fuel-efficient cars <br>
       solved many of the problems I worried about as a college freshman in 1979.br
        Yet these new solutions also cause new problems. For example, the invention of the gasoline <br>
         engine made travel faster and easier but also raised concerns about air pollution and global warming. <br>

     
     This generation has many problems to solve, but as I've worked with college students over the last 25 years, <br>
      I know they are poised and ready to be problem solvers. My goal in writing this article is to motivate students to research problems <br>
       they care about so that they will be poised to find creative and innovative solutions for our future. Below, you will find many questions, <br>
        ideas, links, research, and videos to get you started on your research essay.
